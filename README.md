INTRODUCTION
Modern smart home systems often include a variety of smart tech options including video surveillance and intelligent light controlling. Historically speaking, the structure of a standard home mailbox hasn't changed much in over a century. A homeowner still needs to... go outside and physically open their mailbox in order to check for incoming mail; therefore, there is no visible way for other people to know when new mail arrives other than by using the small flag located at the side of their mailbox. As online shopping becomes increasingly mainstream, package theft has risen dramatically as an increasing concern to consumers. Because rain can cause significant damage to both physical and digital forms of correspondence (letters or documents), and because people cannot easily tell if they have received important items (bills, legal documents, passports), many people have difficulty determining if they have missed something important. Current smart mailboxes on the market are costly, frequently involve recurring subscription costs, and employ intricate designs that are difficult or expensive to fix. Consequently, they are inaccessible to the majority of families 
Most contemporary homes now incorporate some type of smart technology that allows homeowners to interact with smart devices such as video doorbell cameras and smart lighting. Conversely, the mailbox itself has not changed much from its original design dating over 100 years ago (1900). The mailbox continues to require the homeowner to go outside to physically check the mailbox for any mail or packages and still uses a small flag to denote whether or not anything was put into it. There is also a considerable increase in package theft as a result of the increasing popularity of online retail purchases. Additionally, when items such as letters and other important documents, including bills, legal paperwork and news or notices regarding immigration, are sent to the mailbox, there will usually be no way for the homeowner to know where their letter is or when it was mailed. There are smart mailboxes on the market now, but the majority of consumers will find them to be overpriced, often with monthly service fees and complicated design features that can make them very difficult and expensive to repair, thus preventing most consumers from purchasing them.
